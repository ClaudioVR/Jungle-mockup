# Jungle-mockup
This is a mockup project of the musical ban Jungle's website:

https://junglejunglejungle.com/

I first attempted the mockup back when I was first getting to grips with web design and learning the basics of css grid and flexbox.

In Feb 2019, I went back to add and edit features and components to better emulate the original website.
